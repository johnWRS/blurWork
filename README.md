Optimizing OpenGL Blur Shaders

All the associated files for my video on openGL blurs. Note: much of this content is heavily influenced or reused from https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Bloom and https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/an-investigation-of-fast-real-time-gpu-based-image-blur-algorithms.html

texturesStart.cpp is the starting point of the video and texturesCompleted.cpp is the end.

I also included shader_s.h because I added an empty default constructor. To use this it should be placed in LearnOpenGL-master\includes\learnopengl\shader_s.h
